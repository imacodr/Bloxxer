## Paper/Spigot Plugin to Connect Minecraft and Roblox

Ever thought: "I NEED to talk to my friends on Roblox while playing this server"
*...yeah, you probably didnt*

BUT not to worry! This plugin fixes that issue!

 Bloxxer is a cross-communication plugin that allows you to host communication between your Roblox game and your Minecraft server.
It can be useful if you want a platform with multiple different types of games and want to enable cross communication!

Bloxxer is my first plugin made soooo... if its bad... oops?
